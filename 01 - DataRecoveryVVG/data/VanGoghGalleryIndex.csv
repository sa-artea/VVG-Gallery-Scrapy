        ""text"": ""Van Gogh saw the Potato Eaters as a showpiece, for which he deliberately chose a difficult composition to prove he was on his way to becoming a good figure painter. The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they ‘have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish . . . that they have thus honestly earned their food’.  He painted the five figures in earth colours – ‘something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course’. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes. Nowadays, the Potato Eaters is one of Van Gogh’s most famous works."",

Van Gogh instead applied small brushstrokes of varying length in different directions. This helped him to create the effect of a radiant spring day, which fit the sense of intimacy and togetherness he wished to express. He too longed for a wife and a family, but he had 'the most impossible love affairs'. He eventually resigned himself to the situation; he was devoted to his art."",

In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence. The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated ‘gratitude’, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were ‘completely Vincent’. Van Gogh had already painted a new version during his friend’s stay and Gauguin later asked for one as a gift, which Vincent was reluctant to give him. He later produced two loose copies, however, one of which is now in the Van Gogh Museum."",

        ""text"": ""While he was in Arles, Van Gogh made this painting of his bedroom in the Yellow House. He prepared the room himself with simple furniture and with his own work on the wall. The bright colours were meant to express absolute ‘repose’ or ‘sleep’. Research shows that the strongly contrasting colours we see in the work today are the result of discolouration over the years. The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue. \nThe apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Gogh’s part – the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice. Vincent told Theo in a letter that he had deliberately ‘flattened’ the interior and left out the shadows so that his picture would resemble a Japanese print. Van Gogh was very pleased with the painting: ‘When I saw my canvases again after my illness, what seemed to me the best was the bedroom. ’"",

He laid these pairs down side by side to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and the orange-red of his beard. Self-Portrait as a Painter was the last work Van Gogh produced in Paris; the city had exhausted him both mentally and physically.

He wrote to his brother Theo, 'I'd almost believe that these canvases will tell you what I can't say in words, what I consider healthy and fortifying about the countryside. 'The elongated format of Wheatfields under Thunderclouds is unusual. It emphasizes the grandeur of the landscape, as does the simple composition: two horizontal planes."",

The menacing sky, the crows and the dead-end path are said to refer to the end of his life approaching. But that is just a persistent myth. In fact, he made several other works after this one. Van Gogh did want his wheatfields under stormy skies to express 'sadness, extreme loneliness', but at the same time he wanted to show what he considered 'healthy and fortifying about the countryside'. Van Gogh used powerful colour combinations in this painting: the blue sky contrasts with the yellow-orange wheat, while the red of the path is intensified by the green bands of grass."",

This work is part of a series of seven pen and ink drawings of Brabant landscapes from 1884. The compositions are compelling. The way he drew it, with a great deal of hatching, shows his individual style. The drawings form a high point of Van Gogh's work in the Netherlands."",

He realised in 1885 that he needed to build them up from large round forms rather than contours. This burly peasant woman is a successful example. The proportions may not be accurate, but this was deliberate: Van Gogh wanted to make the drawing more expressive. In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent described his drawings of farm workers as 'the start of a whole series about all kinds of work in the fields'. He hoped that scenes of this kind would establish his reputation as an artist of peasant life."",

This is most likely the Porte de Clichy – one of 25 gates leading into the French capital. The lively cityscape is filled with little figures and details like the horse-drawn tram. Van Gogh drew inspiration for this drawing from the crowded street scenes in Japanese prints. The bright colours of those prints also stimulated his creativity. This cityscape is one of the few drawings he made in Paris. He mostly worked in oil paint on canvas during his time there and developed a brighter, more modern colour palette. Colour and brightness also play a central role in this watercolour drawing."",

It shows the church in Nuenen where Vincent's father was the minister. It was the first painting he gave to his parents. The scene differs from Vincent's earlier sketch in a letter and drawing of the church. In both previous versions, there is a peasant with a spade in the foreground. That same farmer is visible in an X-ray image of the painting. This shows that Van Gogh altered parts of the painting later. He replaced the peasant with a group of churchgoers and added autumn leaves to the bare trees and the hedge. The canvas is on an original stretcher frame with traces of paint. Van Gogh probably wiped off his brushes on the stretcher."",

'The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other, ' he wrote. The subject continued to fascinate him. Four years later, in France, he returned to drawing and painting old houses.

Vincent described this work to Theo as 'a still life of an open, hence an off-white Bible, bound in leather, against a black background with a yellow-brown foreground, with an additional note of lemon yellow. ' He wanted to show that the colour black could be effective. The brothers had previously discussed this question at length. Theo thought Vincent's canvases were too dark and gloomy.

'The heads of these women here with the white caps — it’s difficult — but it’s so eternally beautiful', he wrote. At first glance, this woman's headdress looks white, but if you look more carefully you can see that Van Gogh used a variety of colours. Out of all the study heads from Nuenen, this woman is the only one whose name is known: Gordina de Groot. She is also at the table in The Potato Eaters."",

He had made that earlier study – of a standing nude woman – in the atelier of Fernand Cormon (1845-1924) in Paris. He took lessons there in the spring of 1886. Instead of scraping off the painting beneath this one, he painted his self-portrait over it. He did, however, cover the woman with a new ground layer first."",

For instance, the mainly rusty orange leaves are set against the contrasting blue of the background. And he has deliberately placed occasional green and red accents next to each other on the stem of the plant and elsewhere. Colour pairs of this kind are basic to the colour theory of French artist Eugène Delacroix (1798-1863). Van Gogh was a great admirer of Delacroix."",

He covered up the earlier image with a layer of zinc white – a kind of paint that dries extremely slowly. The drying out process continued after the skull had been painted over it, causing cracks to form in the top layer of paint."",

Van Gogh used dashes of paint in all sorts of colours, side by side and sometimes layered. This was his own free variation on Pointillism.

Along with the tree trunk on the right, it brings depth to the scene. Van Gogh drew strength from nature: 'Sometimes it's precisely those spots where one no longer feels anything of what's known as the civilized world . . . sometimes it's precisely those spots that one needs to achieve calm.

Van Gogh hoped that this subject would sell well. He took the fresh, pure colours – the white of the fields and bright blue of the sheds – from contemporary French art. To render sunlight in this landscape, Van Gogh used highly diluted oil paint. This resulted in a translucent, matt effect. He chose a canvas with an unusual, elongated shape. That creates an effect like that of a wide-angle lens. The paths and gardens fan out, drawing our eyes toward the horizon."",

Van Gogh combined the azure blue of the sky with yellow and green tones for the land to capture the atmosphere of a summer’s day. He worked in the wheatfields for days at a time under the burning sun. This was an immensely productive period, in which he completed ten paintings and five drawings in just over a week, until a heavy storm brought the harvest season to an end. Van Gogh wanted to show peasant life and work on the land – a recurring theme in his art – and painted several stages of the harvest. We see a half mowed wheatfield, ladders and several carts. A reaper works in the background, which is why he titled the work La moisson or 'The Harvest'. Van Gogh considered it one of his most successful paintings, writing to his brother Theo that the ‘canvas absolutely kills all the rest’."",

These stylistic elements were familiar to Van Gogh from his collection of Japanese prints.

He did draw the boats there, however, and later made this painting at home."",

In addition to the blue and white that he brushed onto the canvas with bold strokes, he used green and yellow for the waves. He applied these colours with a palette knife, neatly capturing the effect of the light through the waves. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the colours of the Mediterranean Sea. He wrote that it ‘has a colour like mackerel, in other words, changing – you don’t always know if it’s green or purple – you don’t always know if it’s blue – because a second later, its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue’. The bright red signature has been placed prominently in the foreground: it was intended as a ‘red note in the green’."",

He also painted a pendant of this work with a daytime atmosphere: his own simple peasant chair in bright yellow and blue. The two paintings represent the different personalities of the two artists, who quarrelled and went their separate ways soon afterwards. Van Gogh skilfully captured the bluish shadows and reflected light on the polished wood of the chair. These were created by the gas lighting (a gas lamp can be seen in the background)."",

Camille was the youngest son of the postman Joseph Roulin, a friend of Van Gogh's. Vincent always had a hard time finding models. It was a stroke of luck that the Roulins agreed to sit for him. He painted more than twenty portraits of the family. Van Gogh made two versions of his portrait of Camille. He sent this one to Theo and gave the other one to the Roulins."",

In a triptych, three works are combined into one harmonious whole. Van Gogh was familiar with this idea from Japanese prints. Van Gogh went on to produce no fewer than fourteen paintings of fruit trees in blossom in the space of a month. He hoped his orchard paintings would sell. To his brother Theo he wrote, 'You know these subjects are among the ones that cheer everyone up. '"",

From Delacroix, Van Gogh took the theme of the Virgin Mary mourning the dead Christ, as well as the composition. He added his own colour and personal signature. The painting resulted from an accident. Van Gogh wrote, 'that lithograph of Delacroix, the Pietà, with other sheets had fallen into some oil and paint and got spoiled. I was sad about it – then in the meantime I occupied myself painting it, and you'll see it one day. ' The lithograph has survived, complete with stain."",

This painting is a copy of a print by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875). Over the years, the colours have changed dramatically. The contrasts were originally much greater.

Van Gogh wrote to his friend Bernard about this painting: ‘You’ll understand that this combination of red ochre, of green saddened with grey, of black lines that define the outlines, this gives rise a little to the feeling of anxiety from which some of my companions in misfortune often suffer, and which is called “seeing red”. ’Van Gogh had discovered that he could use colours to express a feeling. He intensified the emotional charge of his works by combining colours to create harmony on the one hand, or contrast on the other."",

The Sheaf Binder comes from a 10-part series entitled Travaux des champs (‘Work in the Fields’).

Van Gogh made his paintings of olive groves just after his friends Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard had painted a number of religious scenes. They created those works from their imaginations. Van Gogh disagreed with that approach. He felt that reality should always be the starting point: 'My ambition is truly limited to a few clods of earth, some sprouting wheat.

While working on this painting, Van Gogh was not feeling well: he sensed an attack of his illness coming on. Nonetheless, he was pleased with the result: 'there's something sad in [it] that's healthy, and that's why it doesn't annoy me. '"",

Because Van Gogh did not have any canvas at hand, he painted the garden on a red and white striped tea towel. He first covered the towel with a bright pink ground layer of lead-white pigment mixed with red. This pink base formed a vivid contrast with the green paint he used for the garden. The ground layer is visible between the strokes of paint. The red pigment has faded over time, so the pink base now looks grey."",

Throughout the ten years that Van Gogh worked as an artist, he experimented with different ways of applying paint. This landscape shows a large variety of brushstrokes. For the plants in the foreground, he used rounded, flowing brushwork. For the string of coloured roofs in the middle, he used vertical stripes. The green fields beyond the village are areas of nearly uniform colour. The sky is unfinished. He outlined the clouds with a few swift streaks of blue."",

He spread the paint for the white crests of the waves on the canvas unmixed. The strong wind made painting difficult. Grains of sand were blown into the paint all over the canvas. Although this is one of his first oil paintings, Van Gogh's unique brushwork is already easy to recognise."",

Take the grains of wheat that Van Gogh's sower is scattering behind him. In the original painting, there were birds there.

Van Gogh achieved this effect through the use of white paint, while he drew the rest of the picture in pencil and brown ink. The dark figures on the dimly lit field stand out sharply against the brightly illuminated horizon. Van Gogh had gone to spend a couple of months in Drenthe in the autumn of 1883. Fellow-artists had told him about the beauty of the landscape. And although he sometimes felt that the heathland was ‘as irritatingly tedious and fatiguing as the desert’ in the clear light of day, in the low evening light he found it ‘sublime’."",

Van Gogh used pen and ink over a preliminary drawing in pencil. He added a few accents in opaque white paint for the frost-covered plants along the bank. There is also a little white on the kingfisher's wings. Van Gogh signed this drawing and sent it to the artist Anthon van Rappard (1858-1892). Soon afterwards, he sent him the poem by Jules Breton (1827-1906) on which the scene is based."",

The words translate as ‘digger in a potato field, February’. He probably intended to produce a traditional series of pictures of work on the land, one for each month of the year. From his letters, we know that Van Gogh did not in fact draw this raw-boned peasant in February, but in the summer of 1885. It’s amazing that he could persuade a farm worker to pose for him right in the middle of the busy harvest period."",

' So he invited his brother to come and see him while he was at work in his studio. This drawing shows sheaves of grain drying after the harvest.

He was the only student in his class allowed to do that, because he was making such good progress. He added a heavily shaded area."",

A few pencil lines are visible under the missing section – probably part of a beard. So this seems likely to have been another small self-portrait. In these drawings, Van Gogh used a great deal of hatchwork to show the shape of his face. He also used fine lines to render shadows, like those around and between his eyes. These may have been sketches for a painting; he drew himself several times from the same angle."",

The Moulin de la Galette was popular among artists. They went there to dance and drink but also liked to paint there. Van Gogh lived nearby. He made a number of drawings and paintings on the grounds of the mill. After dark, the narrow street was filled with people out for a good time. But Van Gogh chose a quiet daytime moment for his drawing. Could it have been a mistake that the Dutch flag is flying in his painting instead of the French one?"",

It is easy to imagine Van Gogh sitting in the corner of an outdoor café in Paris, sketching the benches, the gnarled trees and the customers. The somewhat gloomy atmosphere of the work comes from the brownish-yellow discolouration of the paper. At the edges, you can see that the paper was originally blue-grey. It must once have had a fresher appearance. Van Gogh made this drawing in pencil, pen and brush and ink. He used white chalk to add a few light accents in the sky."",

He made this drawing in the park in front of the Yellow House, where he became a tenant on 1 May. He used a thin pen for the grass and a thicker one for the shrubs. The direction of the pen strokes also differs for each type of vegetation. This gives each one its own distinct character. Van Gogh used reed pens that he made himself. He found the reeds along the canals around the city. Reed pens create an aesthetically pleasing result, but it's not easy to draw with them. That's why he practiced a great deal."",

And the eyes and nose did not turn out well. Is that because it had been a while since he'd drawn a living model? Or was it because he hadn't used a reed pen for a long time?"",

Vincent warned his brother that he might find the drawing 'too stiff'. He had done that deliberately, so that he could later use the drawing as the basis for a painting.

So he used thinned oil paint on cardboard for this view of the garden of the asylum. He had arrived only recently and was not yet allowed to work beyond the garden walls. Later he was also permitted to draw and paint outside the complex. Here he used not only paint but also coloured ink, which has faded to brown. The paint has also changed colour. This is especially clear in the steps, where the purple hue has become very faint."",

This work is a 'portrait' of part of the stately old city of The Hague: the bridge at the corner of Herengracht and Prinsessegracht. Van Gogh had a hard time drawing the bridge in accurate perspective. So he changed its shape slightly, as shown by a photograph of the same bridge. Uncle Cor was satisfied and ordered another series of cityscapes, this time of Amsterdam."",
