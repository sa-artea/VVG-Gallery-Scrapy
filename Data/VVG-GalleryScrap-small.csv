He was looking specifically for country people, both men and women, who had coarse, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips. He wanted to paint 50 of them as what he called study heads. Their facial features were intended to show that they lived in close communion with nature and the land they farmed. Van Goghs interest in physiognomy may seem odd to us now, but in his own time it was not unusual.""

    ""section"": ""With her hair in a bun and her jewellery, this woman looks perfectly respectable to us. But to Van Goghs contemporaries, her low-cut dress and eye makeup told a different story. Van Gogh painted this woman shortly after moving to Antwerp (BE). He needed models so that he could practise portrait painting. Only ladies of easy virtue could be persuaded to pose for a painter they had never met before. Van Gogh painted this portrait in a single sitting. For the glittering earring, Van Gogh used a thick blob of pinkish-white paint that later fell off.""
