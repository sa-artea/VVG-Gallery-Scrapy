    ""section"": ""Van Gogh saw the Potato Eaters as a showpiece, for which he deliberately chose a difficult composition to prove he was on his way to becoming a good figure painter. The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food. He painted the five figures in earth colours something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes. Nowadays, the Potato Eaters is one of Van Goghs most famous works."",

He used a free variation on the technique of the Pointillists. They built up their compositions from dots of paint. Van Gogh instead applied small brushstrokes of varying length in different directions. This helped him to create the effect of a radiant spring day, which fit the sense of intimacy and togetherness he wished to express. He too longed for a wife and a family, but he had the most impossible love affairs. He eventually resigned himself to the situation; he was devoted to his art.""

He laid these pairs down side by side to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and the orange-red of his beard. Self-Portrait as a Painter was the last work Van Gogh produced in Paris; the city had exhausted him both mentally and physically. He told his sister Wil how he had portrayed himself: wrinkles in forehead and around the mouth, stiffly wooden, a very red beard, quite unkempt and sad."",

In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence. The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated gratitude, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were completely Vincent. Van Gogh had already painted a new version during his friends stay and Gauguin later asked for one as a gift, which Vincent was reluctant to give him.

    ""section"": ""While he was in Arles, Van Gogh made this painting of his bedroom in the Yellow House. He prepared the room himself with simple furniture and with his own work on the wall. The bright colours were meant to express absolute repose or sleep. Research shows that the strongly contrasting colours we see in the work today are the result of discolouration over the years. The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue.\r. The apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Goghs part the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice. Vincent told Theo in a letter that he had deliberately flattened the interior and left out the shadows so that his picture would resemble a Japanese print. Van Gogh was very pleased with the painting: When I saw my canvases again after my illness, what seemed to me the best was the bedroom."",

Only after that do you realise that it shows a slope with tree trunks and roots. These are trees used for timber, growing in a marl quarry. Such quarries could be found around Auvers (FR). The work was not entirely completed. That explains its unfinished appearance. It is probably Van Goghs very last painting. Andries Bonger, the brother-in-law of Vincents brother Theo, described it in a letter: The morning before his death, he had painted a sous-bois [forest scene], full of sun and life.""

He couldnt decide, so he was experimenting with all sorts of interior light effects. In this picture, he was attempting to paint a figure against the light. It was hard to do, he wrote to his brother Theo, its a difficult effect. With the almost black head of the woman and using a lot of white in the window, he succeeded in achieving a strong contrast. He concentrated the light from the window mainly on the womans hands."",

Vincent described this work to Theo as a still life of an open, hence an off-white Bible, bound in leather, against a black background with a yellow-brown foreground, with an additional note of lemon yellow. He wanted to show that the colour black could be effective. The brothers had previously discussed this question at length. Theo thought Vincents canvases were too dark and gloomy.

    ""section"": ""Van Gogh painted this scene of a street in the middle of the lively Montmartre district. The unpaved street has stone gutters, represented by blue stripes. The mill on wheels in the centre was probably a movable billboard. There were several real mills on the hill of Montmartre in Paris, and one is visible in the background (the Moulin a Poivre). In Van Goghs day, these mills were no longer in operation but served as an entertainment venue and tourist attraction. The entrances were decorated with flags.""

Van Gogh hoped that this subject would sell well. He took the fresh, pure colours the white of the fields and bright blue of the sheds from contemporary French art. To render sunlight in this landscape, Van Gogh used highly diluted oil paint. This resulted in a translucent, matt effect. He chose a canvas with an unusual, elongated shape. That creates an effect like that of a wide-angle lens. The paths and gardens fan out, drawing our eyes toward the horizon.""

    ""section"": ""Van Gogh painted this self-portrait in the winter of 188788, when he had been in Paris for almost two years. It is clear from the work that he had studied the technique of the Pointillists and applied it in his own, original way. He placed the short stripes of paint in different directions. Where they follow the outline of his head, they form a kind of halo. The painting is also one of Van Goghs boldest colour experiments in Paris. He placed complementary colours alongside one another using long brushstrokes: blue and orange in the background, and red and green in the beard and eyes. The colours intensify one another. The red pigment has faded, so the purple strokes are now blue, which means the contrast with the yellow is less powerful.""

That way of life was associated with artistic types and prostitutes. Van Gogh had organized an exhibition at the cafe to sell his collection of Japanese prints.

He showed with this still life that he was a genuine colourist, working almost exclusively with shades of yellow, as well as a little green, blue, red and pink. He used threads of wool to try out colour combinations before beginning to paint. Van Gogh also painted the frame of this work. It is the only original frame that has survived. He dedicated the painting to Theo, who had frequently encouraged him to add more colour to his work."",

This was an immensely productive period, in which he completed ten paintings and five drawings in just over a week, until a heavy storm brought the harvest season to an end. Van Gogh wanted to show peasant life and work on the land a recurring theme in his art and painted several stages of the harvest. We see a half mowed wheatfield, ladders and several carts.

    ""section"": ""For this farmhouse in a field near Arles (FR), Van Gogh used bright, unmixed colours. This work illustrates what he had learned in Paris. There he had encountered a variety of new art movements, including Impressionism and Pointillism. As soon as he arrived in the southern city of Arles, he began painting his surroundings. He tried to use everything he had learned to find a style of his own. For instance, he varied his brushwork from dots and specks to larger strokes. In this painting, that technique is most clearly visible in the tree.""

In the landscape, he felt he could see a reflection of the world he knew from his collection of Japanese prints. Japanese artists used large areas of colour in their compositions, often with a sharp diagonal. They also regularly zoomed in on a detail in the foreground. Van Gogh adopted these elements in his paintings. It was just like a Japanese dream, he wrote in a letter to his brother Theo. The painting was recently examined and restored. In the process, the old discoloured varnish layer which had dulled the colours was removed. The colours are now much brighter.""

    ""section"": ""Vincent intended his painting Entrance to a Quarry to be matt in colour without looking impressive. It was the first time since moving to France that he returned to a muted colour palette. In the Netherlands, he had always used sober colours. But since then, he had adopted the bright hues of the Impressionists. This painting turned out very differently from his Dutch works, however, because he used different pigments. While working on this painting, Van Gogh was not feeling well: he sensed an attack of his illness coming on. theless, he was pleased with the result: theres something sad in [it] thats healthy, and thats why it doesnt annoy me."",

He was fascinated by the ever-changing colour of the olive trees and tried to find a good way of painting their irregular growth.

Van Gogh made his paintings of olive groves just after his friends Paul Gauguin and Emile Bernard had painted a number of religious scenes. They created those works from their imaginations. Van Gogh disagreed with that approach. He felt that reality should always be the starting point: My ambition is truly limited to a few clods of earth, some sprouting wheat.

The spool might have been this bobbin winder a device used to wind spun thread onto a bobbin or spool. Weavers in Van Goghs time were already working with mechanically spun thread, but the thread was still spooled manually.. . The execution of the painting is deft, smooth and thin so thin in places that the ground layer and transparent green base colour are still visible. Van Gogh was fascinated by lighting effects, and there is a powerful element of backlighting in this painting. He uses touches of light grey to represent the fall of light on the bobbin winder, while the white and yellow highlights intensify the contrasts between light and shade.. . The objects were probably lit from three sides: not only by the window on the left, but also from above and by a lamp in front of the basket to the left. The shadows of the bobbin winders legs do not, however, tally exactly with these light sources: all three fall at different angles.""

In the spring and summer of 1885, Van Gogh drew and painted other women wearing shawls over their heads in this way. They were worn at funerals or when in mourning."",

He used the Neo-Impressionist style here, with short, rough brushstrokes. These alternate with longer strokes, such as the orange in his beard. The background was originally purple (a mix of red and blue), but the red pigment has discoloured and has become almost completely transparent.""

He used long dashes for the water, small dots for the trees and plants, and larger brushstrokes for the sky.

But perhaps its worth thinking less about what Van Gogh was painting here than about how he painted it using little dots and dashes to depict light and shade. He picked up this way of painting from the Neo-Impressionists. Their style is sometimes called Pointillism (or dotted art) and it was the very latest thing in Paris at that time. Paul Signac was one of their leading lights. Van Gogh got to know him after he moved to the French capital.""

He painted The Bridge at Courbevoie in a single session, focusing on the reflections in the water. He was less concerned with using correct perspective or with the proportions of the human figures. Van Gogh used dashes of paint in all sorts of colours, side by side and sometimes layered. This was his own free variation on Pointillism. That method was familiar to him from the work of artists such as Georges Seurat (1859-1891) and Paul Signac (1863-1935). They used mainly small dots of colour."",

The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other, he wrote. The subject continued to fascinate him. Four years later, in France, he returned to drawing and painting old houses. Over the years, however, his style of painting had changed significantly: by that time, he used bright colours and loose brushwork."",

Rue Lepic, where he lived with his brother Theo, began on the right, just beyond the edge of the picture. In Paris, Van Gogh was exposed to the latest art movements of his day, Impressionism and Pointillism. This gradually led him to use lighter colours. He also experimented with a variety of painting techniques. His style of brushwork, with many dashes of paint side by side, shows the influence of these art movements. In the same paintings, he also tried out diluted oil paint.""

    ""section"": ""It takes a while to figure out what makes this painting so unusual. Van Gogh made the sky largely yellow and the foreground blue. This was his way of suggesting the fall of night. The three figures between the trees are no more than silhouettes. The painting clearly shows that Square Saint-Pierre in Paris was a fairly new park in Van Goghs day. The trees are still young. Now called Square Louise-Michel, it leads up to the Sacre Coeur Basilica, one of the citys most famous churches. The basilica was then under construction.""

So when Vincent arrived in the village, he went to see Daubignys home and garden as soon as he could. This is Van Goghs first painting of the garden. He later made two larger ones on canvas. Because Van Gogh did not have any canvas at hand, he painted the garden on a red and white striped tea towel. He first covered the towel with a bright pink ground layer of lead-white pigment mixed with red. This pink base formed a vivid contrast with the green paint he used for the garden. The ground layer is visible between the strokes of paint. The red pigment has faded over time, so the pink base now looks grey.""

    ""section"": ""This work shows part of the village of Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris. Van Gogh spent the last two months of his life there. Throughout the ten years that Van Gogh worked as an artist, he experimented with different ways of applying paint. This landscape shows a large variety of brushstrokes. For the plants in the foreground, he used rounded, flowing brushwork. For the string of coloured roofs in the middle, he used vertical stripes. The green fields beyond the village are areas of nearly uniform colour. The sky is unfinished. He outlined the clouds with a few swift streaks of blue.""

The painting seems somewhat like a panorama because of its wide format. It is one metre wide and 50 centimetres high. Starting in June 1890, Van Gogh made a total of thirteen works with these dimensions. All but one are landscapes. He cut the canvases himself from a large roll.""

He painted the bunch of flowers in the home of his doctor, Paul-Ferdinand Gachet (1828-1909), whom he described as a ready-made friend and something like a new brother.

Although Van Gogh was sometimes frightened of the other patients, he did make portraits of two of them. The end of the cigarette is burning brightly, as if the man has just taken a puff.""

In addition to the blue and white that he brushed onto the canvas with bold strokes, he used green and yellow for the waves. He applied these colours with a palette knife, neatly capturing the effect of the light through the waves. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the colours of the Mediterranean Sea. He wrote that it has a colour like mackerel, in other words, changing you dont always know if its green or purple you dont always know if its blue because a second later, its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue. The bright red signature has been placed prominently in the foreground: it was intended as a red note in the green."",

It was at this time that he painted these clogs. The clogs are shown in close-up, on a rather unnaturally tilted surface. Van Gogh had employed this unusual way of handling perspective before.

Thin paint alternates with thick: for the light reflections on the skull he has used heavy splodges of light-coloured paint. Drying cracks are visible in many places. Look at the area immediately below the skull, for example. The paint has cracked because Van Gogh painted the skull over an earlier picture. He covered up the earlier image with a layer of zinc white a kind of paint that dries extremely slowly. The drying out process continued after the skull had been painted over it, causing cracks to form in the top layer of paint.""

He had a preference for things that bore the scars of life. Only then were they of interest to him. In this picture, Van Gogh used oil paint heavily thinned with turpentine. You can see this from the way the line at the back of the right-hand shoe has dribbled downwards. Thinned oil paint produces a similar effect to watercolour and is known as peinture a lessence.

He was training at the time under Anton Mauve, a famous artist and his cousin by marriage. In Mauves studio, Vincent was permitted to paint this work in oils right away. For a student artist, this was a fairly rare opportunity. The painting was primarily an exercise in colour, surfaces and brushwork. It must have been a great challenge for Van Gogh to convey the different textures of the tabletop, the potatoes and the fabric. It was his first attempt and shows no sign as yet of the characteristic Van Gogh style."",

This is the rear view of that house. The painting makes a grim impression, reinforced by the thin layer of snow on the rooftops. In some places, it looks as if the snow is already melting.""

Only ladies of easy virtue could be persuaded to pose for a painter they had never met before. Van Gogh painted this portrait in a single sitting.

The effect is enhanced by his use of mainly muted colours elsewhere in the picture.

The smock, hat and background consist of large, outlined areas of colour. The face and beard are built up in more detail using different tones. Van Gogh was practising painting portraits. Because models were expensive, he bought a good mirror and used himself as his subject. He later wrote to his brother Theo: because if I can manage to paint the coloration of my own head, which is not without presenting some difficulty, Ill surely be able to paint the heads of the other fellows and women as well."",

    ""section"": ""Van Gogh had always used generous amounts of paint. But after discovering the flower still lifes of Adolphe Monticelli (1824-1886) in June 1886, he went one step further. That French artist painted colourful bouquets with thick paint and emphatic brushstrokes. Van Gogh compared them to liquid clay. In still lifes such as Vase with Chinese Asters and Gladioli, you can see how thickly he began applying the paint to the canvas in his own flowers. The vase shown here has been preserved and is now in the Van Gogh Museum collection. It is smaller in reality than in the painting. The large bouquet of flowers shown here would never fit inside it."",

But he painted the flame nettle as a colour study. He has used what are called complementary colours. For instance, the mainly rusty orange leaves are set against the contrasting blue of the background. And he has deliberately placed occasional green and red accents next to each other on the stem of the plant and elsewhere. Colour pairs of this kind are basic to the colour theory of French artist Eugene Delacroix (1798-1863). Van Gogh was a great admirer of Delacroix."",

He had an attractive red lacquer box in which he kept his balls of wool. That testing method was used for this painting.""
