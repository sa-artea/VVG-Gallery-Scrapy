    ""section"": ""Van Gogh saw the Potato Eaters as a showpiece, for which he deliberately chose a difficult composition to prove he was on his way to becoming a good figure painter. The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food. He painted the five figures in earth colours something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes. Nowadays, the Potato Eaters is one of Van Goghs most famous works."",

    ""section"": ""Van Gogh called this sunny park scene the painting of the garden with lovers. Couples in love are strolling under the young chestnut trees and sitting along the winding paths. He used a free variation on the technique of the Pointillists. They built up their compositions from dots of paint. Van Gogh instead applied small brushstrokes of varying length in different directions. This helped him to create the effect of a radiant spring day, which fit the sense of intimacy and togetherness he wished to express. He too longed for a wife and a family, but he had the most impossible love affairs. He eventually resigned himself to the situation; he was devoted to his art.""

He showed that he was a modern artist by using a new painting style, with bright, almost unblended colours. The palette contains the complementary colour pairs red/green, yellow/purple and blue/orange precisely the colours Van Gogh used for this painting. He laid these pairs down side by side to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and the orange-red of his beard. Self-Portrait as a Painter was the last work Van Gogh produced in Paris; the city had exhausted him both mentally and physically. He told his sister Wil how he had portrayed himself: wrinkles in forehead and around the mouth, stiffly wooden, a very red beard, quite unkempt and sad."",

Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow and nothing else. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence. The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated gratitude, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were completely Vincent. Van Gogh had already painted a new version during his friends stay and Gauguin later asked for one as a gift, which Vincent was reluctant to give him.

The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue.\r. The apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Goghs part the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice. Vincent told Theo in a letter that he had deliberately flattened the interior and left out the shadows so that his picture would resemble a Japanese print. Van Gogh was very pleased with the painting: When I saw my canvases again after my illness, what seemed to me the best was the bedroom."",

He added, however, that this death was almost smiling. Its all yellow except for a line of violet hills a pale, blond yellow.

He wanted to use the dead pollard willow beneath a threatening sky to create a sombre landscape with a railway signalman who, according to the artist, is thinking: how gloomy it is today.. . Pollard Willow is a detailed watercolour. On the horizon, Van Gogh carefully drew the railway depot at Rijnspoor station in pen and ink. The lampposts, the locomotive, from which smoke rises, and the small figure of the signalman with his flag are all rendered with great precision. He then completed the scene using watercolours. The path running alongside the willow is black with coal dust.. . Van Gogh produced his first large, fully-fledged watercolours in The Hague and this was the one with which he was most satisfied.

Vincent described this work to Theo as a still life of an open, hence an off-white Bible, bound in leather, against a black background with a yellow-brown foreground, with an additional note of lemon yellow. He wanted to show that the colour black could be effective. The brothers had previously discussed this question at length. Theo thought Vincents canvases were too dark and gloomy. He encouraged his brother to use lighter, brighter tones, as the Impressionists did."",

    ""section"": ""Van Gogh painted this self-portrait in the winter of 188788, when he had been in Paris for almost two years. It is clear from the work that he had studied the technique of the Pointillists and applied it in his own, original way. He placed the short stripes of paint in different directions. Where they follow the outline of his head, they form a kind of halo. The painting is also one of Van Goghs boldest colour experiments in Paris. He placed complementary colours alongside one another using long brushstrokes: blue and orange in the background, and red and green in the beard and eyes. The colours intensify one another. The red pigment has faded, so the purple strokes are now blue, which means the contrast with the yellow is less powerful.""

That way of life was associated with artistic types and prostitutes. Van Gogh had organized an exhibition at the cafe to sell his collection of Japanese prints.

The boats are made up of areas of uniform colour within strong outlines. Furthermore, the boats dont cast shadows on the beach. These stylistic elements were familiar to Van Gogh from his collection of Japanese prints. Van Gogh would have preferred to make this painting on the beach, but he couldnt, because the fishermen put out to sea very early every morning. He did draw the boats there, however, and later made this painting at home.""

Van Gogh combined the azure blue of the sky with yellow and green tones for the land to capture the atmosphere of a summers day. He worked in the wheatfields for days at a time under the burning sun. This was an immensely productive period, in which he completed ten paintings and five drawings in just over a week, until a heavy storm brought the harvest season to an end. Van Gogh wanted to show peasant life and work on the land a recurring theme in his art and painted several stages of the harvest. We see a half mowed wheatfield, ladders and several carts. A reaper works in the background, which is why he titled the work La moisson or The Harvest. Van Gogh considered it one of his most successful paintings, writing to his brother Theo that the canvas absolutely kills all the rest."",

Van Gogh was captivated by the flowering fruit trees in Provence, so he made a whole series of paintings of trees in blossom. Van Gogh was a great admirer of Japanese printmaking and drew inspiration from it. Japanese artists often took spring blossoms as their subject. But Van Gogh adopted more than just their subject matter. The composition of his painting also shows a Japanese influence, with the small tree in the foreground and the high viewpoint.""

Van Gogh skilfully captured the bluish shadows and reflected light on the polished wood of the chair. These were created by the gas lighting (a gas lamp can be seen in the background)."",

Weavers in Van Goghs time were already working with mechanically spun thread, but the thread was still spooled manually.. . The execution of the painting is deft, smooth and thin so thin in places that the ground layer and transparent green base colour are still visible. Van Gogh was fascinated by lighting effects, and there is a powerful element of backlighting in this painting. He uses touches of light grey to represent the fall of light on the bobbin winder, while the white and yellow highlights intensify the contrasts between light and shade.. . The objects were probably lit from three sides: not only by the window on the left, but also from above and by a lamp in front of the basket to the left. The shadows of the bobbin winders legs do not, however, tally exactly with these light sources: all three fall at different angles.""

The result is a play of light and shadow on the ground between the trees. The strip of yellow in the middle suggests the sunlight of a clearing in the distance. Along with the tree trunk on the right, it brings depth to the scene. Van Gogh drew strength from nature: Sometimes its precisely those spots where one no longer feels anything of whats known as the civilized world ... sometimes its precisely those spots that one needs to achieve calm."",

He used long dashes for the water, small dots for the trees and plants, and larger brushstrokes for the sky.

But perhaps its worth thinking less about what Van Gogh was painting here than about how he painted it using little dots and dashes to depict light and shade. He picked up this way of painting from the Neo-Impressionists. Their style is sometimes called Pointillism (or dotted art) and it was the very latest thing in Paris at that time. Paul Signac was one of their leading lights. Van Gogh got to know him after he moved to the French capital.""

The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other, he wrote.

In Paris, Van Gogh was exposed to the latest art movements of his day, Impressionism and Pointillism. This gradually led him to use lighter colours. He also experimented with a variety of painting techniques. His style of brushwork, with many dashes of paint side by side, shows the influence of these art movements. In the same paintings, he also tried out diluted oil paint.""

Because Van Gogh did not have any canvas at hand, he painted the garden on a red and white striped tea towel. He first covered the towel with a bright pink ground layer of lead-white pigment mixed with red. This pink base formed a vivid contrast with the green paint he used for the garden. The ground layer is visible between the strokes of paint. The red pigment has faded over time, so the pink base now looks grey.""

    ""section"": ""Van Gogh based this painting on a woodcut by the Japanese artist Kesai Eisen. The print had been reproduced on the cover of the magazine Paris illustre in 1886. Van Gogh used a grid to copy and enlarge the Japanese figure. He used bright colours and bold outlines, as if it were a woodcut. We can tell the woman is a courtesan by her hairstyle and the belt (obi) that she is wearing, which is tied at the front of her kimono rather than at the back. Van Gogh framed her with a pond full of water lilies, bamboo stems, cranes and frogs. This scene has a hidden meaning: grue (crane) and grenouille (frog) were French slang words for prostitute.""

It was done at the fishing village of Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, during a trip he took from Arles in the south of France. In addition to the blue and white that he brushed onto the canvas with bold strokes, he used green and yellow for the waves. He applied these colours with a palette knife, neatly capturing the effect of the light through the waves. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the colours of the Mediterranean Sea. He wrote that it has a colour like mackerel, in other words, changing you dont always know if its green or purple you dont always know if its blue because a second later, its changing reflection has taken on a pink or grey hue. The bright red signature has been placed prominently in the foreground: it was intended as a red note in the green."",

Van Gogh probably painted this portrait to express his gratitude. But Martin never received it. Soon after the exhibition opened, they quarrelled. Martin claimed the pictures were spoiling the appetite of his customers. The exhibition closed early. Van Gogh painted le patron (the boss) in his working clothes. He originally used brighter colours for the portrait but changed his mind and chose muted tones instead. The red pigment has faded over time, unintentionally making the colours even softer than Van Gogh intended.""

For a student artist, this was a fairly rare opportunity. The painting was primarily an exercise in colour, surfaces and brushwork.

Only ladies of easy virtue could be persuaded to pose for a painter they had never met before. Van Gogh painted this portrait in a single sitting.

    ""section"": ""After a long period of psychological crisis, Van Gogh had lost his confidence in himself, as a person and as a painter. For a long time, he felt useless and did not even dare to go outside. To build up his self-confidence again, he started copying prints a common exercise for beginning painters. This painting is a copy of a print by Jean-Francois Millet (1814-1875). Over the years, the colours have changed dramatically. The contrasts were originally much greater. It is now a bluish-green landscape, against which the black birds (crows or rooks) stand out strongly.""

That French artist painted colourful bouquets with thick paint and emphatic brushstrokes. Van Gogh compared them to liquid clay. In still lifes such as Vase with Chinese Asters and Gladioli, you can see how thickly he began applying the paint to the canvas in his own flowers. The vase shown here has been preserved and is now in the Van Gogh Museum collection. It is smaller in reality than in the painting.

But he painted the flame nettle as a colour study. He has used what are called complementary colours. For instance, the mainly rusty orange leaves are set against the contrasting blue of the background. And he has deliberately placed occasional green and red accents next to each other on the stem of the plant and elsewhere. Colour pairs of this kind are basic to the colour theory of French artist Eugene Delacroix (1798-1863). Van Gogh was a great admirer of Delacroix."",

    ""section"": ""Van Goghs parents lived in the Brabant village of Nuenen, which was the workplace of many weavers. Van Gogh had been keen to draw and paint them for quite some time. He felt the subject was a gap in the market, since it had received almost no attention from other artists. There was little room to draw inside the cramped weavers cottages. Even so, Van Gogh often made sketches. One eyewitness reported that he sometimes had to sit in the passageway to do so. Finished drawings like this were made later, in his studio.""

    ""section"": ""This gate was the entrance to the grounds of the Moulin de la Galette, an entertainment venue on the hill of Montmartre in Paris. The mill was surrounded by a dance hall and cafes, including an outdoor cafe with a view of the city. The mill was no longer in operation but served as an attraction. The Moulin de la Galette was popular among artists. They went there to dance and drink but also liked to paint there. Van Gogh lived nearby. He made a number of drawings and paintings on the grounds of the mill. After dark, the narrow street was filled with people out for a good time. But Van Gogh chose a quiet daytime moment for his drawing. Could it have been a mistake that the Dutch flag is flying in his painting instead of the French one?""

He made a large series of studies of heads like these, partly to practise depicting faces and expressions. In the case of this old man, he was successful: his sunken cheeks and the weary look in his eyes seem completely authentic. In this drawing, Van Gogh used many different shades of black. He scratched away some of the deep black lithographic ink in the hat to suggest a gleaming stripe.""

He drew the moth with black chalk, paying considerable attention to the details. He applied the tone of the wings by carefully rubbing the chalk away. Van Gogh used a fine pen and brown ink to fill in the legs and antennae, added a few little lines to the wings and drew an extra outline around them. He accentuated the dark parts of the moth by thickly applying brown ink. He used the same ink with a pen and brush to draw a frame around the image. There was a particular reason Van Gogh drew the emperor moth rather than painting it, as [he wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let776/letter.html) to Theo: To paint it I would have had to kill it, and that would have been a shame since the animal was so beautiful. He did, however, paint another version later, basing himself on this drawing, which is how the splashes of oil paint got onto the paper.""

He gives clear indications of the differences in their clothing, sometimes using just dots or stripes, sometimes adding blue chalk. On the roof of the farmstead he has written rouge (red). Usually when he made notes of this kind, it was because he intended to use the drawing as the basis for a painting. He probably didnt get round to it; at any rate, no similar landscape in oils is now known to us.""

He sought to achieve similar precision with this drawing of a periwinkle plant.. . Van Gogh began by drawing the little branch in pencil and black chalk. He then coloured the leaves, outlines and leaf veins using blue-black ink, which has now partially faded to brown.. . . The drawing was made at the clinic in Saint-Remy, the garden of which was full of periwinkles. Van Gogh might have drawn the branch outside, or in the extra room he was assigned for use as a studio. Traces of oil and coloured ink suggest that the drawing lay around there for some time, while the eighteen little holes in the paper are evidence that it was pinned up on the wall several times.""

    ""section"": ""During bouts of illness at the psychiatric hospital in Saint-Remy, Van Gogh frequently thought of returning to the Netherlands.

This drawing shows Dutch-style houses with low hedges in the hilly landscape around Saint-Remy. Van Gogh usually took reality as the starting point for his art, but here he merges that reality with memories of his native region. He placed agricultural labourers a frequent theme of his in the Netherlands prominently in the foreground. He was not so impressed, however, by southern French peasants. In our country one sees men, women, children, animals at work everywhere and at all times of the year, and here not a third of that, and in addition theyre not the honest workers of the north. They seem to work the land in an awkward, lax way, without energy, [he wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let779/letter.html) to his brother Theo.""

He made this drawing in the park in front of the Yellow House, where he became a tenant on 1 May. He used a thin pen for the grass and a thicker one for the shrubs. The direction of the pen strokes also differs for each type of vegetation. This gives each one its own distinct character. Van Gogh used reed pens that he made himself. He found the reeds along the canals around the city. Reed pens create an aesthetically pleasing result, but its not easy to draw with them. Thats why he practiced a great deal.""

Japanese art was a major source of inspiration for Van Gogh. For this view of La Crau, for instance, he drew on the hatched prints and drawings of the Japanese. He used a wide variety of strokes, dots and crosses to emphasize the flatness of the landscape. He wrote to his friend, the artist Emile Bernard, It does NOT look Japanese, and its actually the most Japanese thing that Ive done."",

It is easy to imagine Van Gogh sitting in the corner of an outdoor cafe in Paris, sketching the benches, the gnarled trees and the customers. The somewhat gloomy atmosphere of the work comes from the brownish-yellow discolouration of the paper. At the edges, you can see that the paper was originally blue-grey. It must once have had a fresher appearance. Van Gogh made this drawing in pencil, pen and brush and ink. He used white chalk to add a few light accents in the sky.""

This work is a portrait of part of the stately old city of The Hague: the bridge at the corner of Herengracht and Prinsessegracht. Van Gogh had a hard time drawing the bridge in accurate perspective. So he changed its shape slightly, as shown by a photograph of the same bridge. Uncle Cor was satisfied and ordered another series of cityscapes, this time of Amsterdam.""

He was the only student in his class allowed to do that, because he was making such good progress. He added a heavily shaded area.""

He admired that approach and sought to achieve something similar in his own work. Van Gogh described this drawing in [a letter](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let782/letter.html) to his brother Theo as a hasty study (letter 782). All the same, he rendered the tassel hyacinths in considerable detail, opting for the Japanese manner and drawing the little flower buds close-up, against a blank background. He went over the pencil lines in brown ink using a fine brush. Van Gogh painted Tassel Hyacinths shortly after entering the psychiatric institution at Saint-Remy. Drawing a precise floral study like this might have helped comfort and sooth him. [He wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let785/letter.html) a few months later that in order to calm himself, he would gaze at a blade of grass, a pine-tree branch, an ear of wheat.""

He saw the sower as a symbol of the cycle of life: growth, flourishing and the harvest. This drawing is based on a black-and-white print of the painting. That led to minor misunderstandings. Take the grains of wheat that Van Goghs sower is scattering behind him. In the original painting, there were birds there. These became dots in the print, which Van Gogh interpreted as seed for sowing.""

Fellow-artists had told him about the beauty of the landscape. And although he sometimes felt that the heathland was as irritatingly tedious and fatiguing as the desert in the clear light of day, in the low evening light he found it sublime.""
